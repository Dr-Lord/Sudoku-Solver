Sudoku Solver
===

Sudoku solving program written for fun sometime in August 2014.
It takes a sudoku from the Sudoku file and returns its solution in the Solution file.
Can solve all sudokus exept for some of the highest possible difficulty ones
(I have not narrowed down what makes them more difficult).

I might pick it up again to try and complete it.
